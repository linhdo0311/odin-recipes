 <h2>Juicy and Tender Teriyaki Chicken</h2>
 <p>First things first: teriyaki is more than just a sauce. It’s actually a cooking technique originating in Japan, involving boiling meat or seafood with a sweet and salty soy glaze. This recipe focuses on the <em>American-style</em> chicken teriyaki you most likely know (and love).</p>
 <p>It’s a little salty, a little sweet, a little sour, and has just the tiniest hint of spice from minced ginger. The best part? This reliable weeknight dinner takes just about half an hour to make. Read on for everything you need to know:</p>
