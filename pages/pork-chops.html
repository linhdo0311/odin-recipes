 <h2>Crispy and Flavorful Pork Chops</h2>
 <p>We get it—pork chops sometimes get a bad rap. If overcooked, they can be dry, bland, and just plan boring. But, cooked correctly, pork chops can be flavorful, and oh so tender. Baking your pork chops will give them a perfectly cooked interior with a crisp, delicious crust.</p>
 <p>There might be no better example of that than in this oven-baked, rosemary and garlic recipe. Serve these pork chops up with roasted veggies and our creamy mashed potatoes for the easiest weeknight dinner you'll be adding to your rotation every week. </p>
